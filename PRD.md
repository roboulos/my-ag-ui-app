## 1. Executive Summary

### Vision
Create an interactive report system that allows Venture Capitalists to interrogate data sources and receive dynamic, real-time visualizations through natural conversation. The system transforms static VC reports into living, breathing documents that adapt to user queries.

### Business Objectives
- **Short-term**: Demonstrate capabilities to VCs as a compelling demo tool
- **Medium-term**: Gather VC insights and data through interviews
- **Long-term**: Productize as a sellable SaaS solution for the VC industry

### Key Innovation
Unlike traditional static reports, this system generates UI components dynamically based on conversation context, providing infinite visualization possibilities rather than switching between pre-made views.

## 7. Use Cases & Scenarios

### 7.1 VC Demo Scenario
**Given**: VC wants to understand government funding trends  
**When**: They ask "Show me SaaS funding by state over last 5 years"  
**Then**: System generates interactive map and timeline chart  
**And**: VC can drill down by asking "What about just California?"  

### 7.2 Investment Analysis
**Given**: VC analyzing portfolio performance  
**When**: They query "Compare our B2B vs B2C investments"  
**Then**: Dynamic comparison charts appear with key metrics  
**And**: Follow-up questions refine the visualization  

### 7.3 Report Enhancement
**Given**: Static report with limited data shown  
**When**: User asks about data not in main report  
**Then**: System accesses full dataset and visualizes answer  
**And**: Provides context within broader report narrative

## Appendix A: Technical Details

### Component Generation Pattern
```typescript
// Example of dynamic component generation
useCopilotAction({
  name: "generateVisualization",
  description: "Generate data visualization based on query",
  parameters: [
    { name: "query", type: "string", description: "User's data query" },
    { name: "dataContext", type: "object", description: "Available data context" }
  ],
  render: ({ status, args }) => {
    // Analyze query intent
    const visualizationType = determineVisualizationType(args.query);
    const data = processDataForVisualization(args.dataContext, args.query);
    
    // Generate appropriate component
    return <DynamicVisualization 
      type={visualizationType}
      data={data}
      query={args.query}
    />;
  }
});
```

### SSE Event Structure
```typescript
// Server-sent event format for UI updates
{
  type: "STATE_DELTA",
  delta: [{
    op: "add",
    path: "/components/-",
    value: {
      component: {
        id: "unique-id",
        type: "chart|metric|document",
        props: {
          // Component-specific properties
        },
        timestamp: "2025-01-08T..."
      }
    }
  }]
}
```
